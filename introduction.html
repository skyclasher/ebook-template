			<h3>History of Desktop Publishing</h3>
			<p align="justify">	Desktop publishing began in 1985 with the introduction of PageMaker software from Aldus and the LaserWriter printer from Apple Computer for the Apple Macintosh computer. 
			The ability to create WYSIWYG page layouts on screen and then print pages at crisp 300 ppi resolution was revolutionary for both the typesetting industry as well as the personal computer industry. 
			The term "desktop publishing" is attributed to Aldus Corporation founder Paul Brainerd, who sought a marketing catch phrase to describe the small size and relative affordability of this suite of products in contrast to the expensive commercial phototypesetting equipment of the day. 
			Often considered a primary skill, increased accessibility to more user friendly DTP software has made DTP a secondary skill to art direction, graphic design, multimedia development, marketing communications, administrative careers and advanced high school literacy in thriving economies. 
			DTP skill levels range from what may be learned in a few hours (e.g. learning how to put clip art in a word processor) to what requires a college education and years of experience (e.g. advertising agency positions.)

			<h3>Copyright issues in desktop</br> publishing</h3>
			<p align="justify"><u>Automatic Copyright Protection</u></br></br>
			Nearly any original creation is protected by copyright laws, whether or not accompanied by a copyright notice. Therefore, when creating any kind of publication or media display, you cannot copy and use any type of image from the Internet without explicit written permission.
			</br></br></br>
			<u>Copyright Valid Regardless of Profit</u></br></br>
			A common misconception is that if a copyrighted work is distributed or used in any way without charging others or otherwise profiting, it may be utilized for the project at hand. This is not the case, and may in fact damage the value or exclusivity of the work by making it widely available.
			</br></br></br>
			<u>Application of the Fair Use Doctrine</u></br></br>		
			Just because something is posted on the Internet, that does not mean it is in the public domain and subject to free use at will. The ease of desktop publishing makes this a particularly vulnerable area. The "fair use" concept was designed as part of U.S. copyright law only for news reporting, 
			research or citation to allow for ease of reference and widespread dissemination of information. Even then, any such usage must be attributed and can only include brief excerpts or references. If it generally negates the necessity to buy the work at hand, then it cannot be used.
			</br></br></br>
			<u>Derivative Works Subject to Copyright Restrictions</u></br></br>		
			Any kind of work created through desktop publishing that is substantially or partially based upon something else, whether in written or image form, remains subject to copyright laws. Despite what may be a new work in significantly different form or otherwise not immediately recognizable as the work of another person, 
			it cannot be used without permission.
			</br></br></br>
			<u>Free Advertising Not a Justification</u></br></br>
			Using desktop publishing to publicize or spread the work of another person may appear to be harmless, and indeed, beneficial to the owner of the work at hand. But only that person can grant permission, and no one else has the right to determine the relative benefits of any kind of usage. 
			This amounts to little more than a rationalization, and is not permitted under copyright laws. Even though permission in such cases is often granted, you must still request permission.

			<h3>Difference between Graphic design</br> and Desktop Publishing</h3>
			<p align="justify">	Graphic design jobs involve the creative process of coming up with the concepts and ideas and arrangements for visually communicating a specific message
			</br></br>
			Desktop publishing is the mechanical process that the designer and the non-designer use to turn their ideas for newsletters, brochures, ads, posters, greeting cards, and other projects into digital files for desktop or commercial printing
